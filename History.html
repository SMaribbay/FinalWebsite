  <h2>Facebook has been notorious for invading their users' privacy, there have been several lawsuits and cases against these tech companies regarding these issues yet not many people seem to understand the severity of the situation.</h2>
  <h2> Facebook uses facial recognition to identify you and notify you if you should be tagged in a post. Pending friends have access to your posts even if you haven't accepted or denied their friend request. Facebook also allows third-party apps to track you and collect data about you without your knowledge.</h2>
  <h2> In early 2021, a federal judge approved a $650m settlement of a privacy lawsuit against Facebook. The lawsuit, filed in Illinois, accused Facebook of failing to get consent to use facial recognition technology to scan photos uploaded by users to create and store faces digitally. </h2>
