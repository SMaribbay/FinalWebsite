      <h2>When you go online, there are many trackers that spy on you. These trackers record your search history and track all of your online activity. Then, they ues this information to paint a clear picture of who you are and what your interests are.
        This is a breach of online privacy and makes you public property. Usually, trackers are used for advertisement purposes only as it allows advertisers to show you ads based on your interests.</h2>
      <h2>Another issue with the way online privacy is handled is when certain websites need your personal information so you can access their content. These websites use cookies to save that information of yours and to later use it for other purposes.
        As it turns out, this information isn't actually encrypted and can be accessed by anyone. </h2>
      <h2> With the rise of social media in recent years, users are constantly posting on Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat about their whereabouts and using geofilters and location tags to show where they currently are. This data is stored on the social media site forever without you even knowing.
        Having your location being constantly tracked isn't the most comforting fact to know. Even with navigation apps like Google Maps, it's still risky letting the entire world know of your exact location.</h2>
