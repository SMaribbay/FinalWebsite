  <h2>The first and most simple answer would be to get a VPN. A VPN encrypts all your online activities so that websites like third-party sites aren't able to track and spy on you. VPN's give you an anonymous IP address and hide your real location by disguising your real identiy.</h2>
  <h2>Using a strong anti-virus program will help prevent your devices from being subject to malware attacks like spyware and viruses. It's important that anti-virus programs keep you updated if there are issues in your devices.</h2>
  <h2> Lastly, it's important to be smart in browsing the internet. There's only so much we can do to minimize the invasion of privacy from other. Don't put all your personal information on social media, like your full name, school you go to, year you graduate, where you live, etc..
     It's important to adjust your settings on your social media apps as much as you can to limit how much they track you.  If a website looks suspicious to you, it probably is and you should navigate away from it as soon as possible.</h2>
